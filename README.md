# In the Calyx [ b1tjam 2 - game jam entry ]

This is my entry for the B1tJam game jam with the theme 'Bloom'

Play my game over on [https://plantainchip.itch.io/in-the-calyx](https://plantainchip.itch.io/in-the-calyx) 

You went into the garden and suddenly an eyeball entity appears from the sky demanding flowers. 
What will you do? 
There are 3 hidden flowers outside. 
Can you find them all?

Note: The collisions and movements are still buggy
